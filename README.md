# Emergency-Response
The Emergency Response Network is a web application that enables users to report emergencies, volunteers to register, and admins to manage responses. Built with React, Node.js, and MongoDB, it features secure authentication, real-time data handling, and role-based access. It also includes a blood donation form to support urgent medical needs.
